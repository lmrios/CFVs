# GUI to control a test rig with Critical Flow Venturies
Since this is a private project, there will be a only a small working part of it.

Critical Flow Venturies (CFVs) are an excellent reference for mass flow.
However CFVs are modeled by fluid mechanics equations which are complex and non linear. 
I think,  if we can find a new model using Neural Networks maybe we can predict how the model will behave at different inlet pressures.

This program plots in real-time the received data on a embedded graph.
Up to now it uses:
- Python3
- PyQt5

### Preview
Here is what it looks like:
